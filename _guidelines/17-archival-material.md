<p>Open data policies can address not only information currently or soon to be available in an electronic format, but also undigitized archival material. Examples include everything from old budgets or meeting minutes to photos and maps.</p>
<p>Questions about what archival material should be digitized and what timelines are realistic for digitizing archival material can be informed by the same kind of prioritization process used for general data release (see <a href="http://sunlightfoundation.com/opendataguidelines/#prioritization">Provision 5</a>). Public participation and feedback from impacted government stakeholders will be key to making the digitization of archival material an effective process.</p>
