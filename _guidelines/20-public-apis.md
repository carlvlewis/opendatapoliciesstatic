<p>Although bulk data (see <a href="http://sunlightfoundation.com/opendataguidelines/#bulk-data">Provision 19</a>) <a href="http://sunlightfoundation.com/blog/2012/03/21/government-do-you-really-need-an-api/">provides the most basic access to searching and retrieving</a> government data, government bodies can also develop APIs, or Application Programming Interfaces, that allow third parties to automatically search, retrieve or submit information directly from databases online (see <a href="http://opengovdata.io/">Open Government Data</a>). Navigating requirements for bulk data and APIs should be done in consultation with people with technical expertise as well as with likely users of the information.</p>
