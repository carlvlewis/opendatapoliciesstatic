<p>Like any other initiative, implementing an open data policy should be done with an eye on long-term sustainability. One way to do this is to consider funding sources for the implementation of the policy as well as its future maintenance. Sufficient funding can mean the difference between successful and unsuccessful policies. Funding should be considered for—but not limited to—the potential of the following: new staff (administrative, technical and legal), new software (to house, extract and input data), training and server maintenance. While each jurisdiction’s ability to fund will vary, significant consideration should go into identifying the resources reserved to assist and support an open data ecosystem.</p>
