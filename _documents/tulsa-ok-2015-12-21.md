<p><strong>Section 1. Purpose</strong> — The purpose of this Executive Order, in part, is to define Open Data, establish an <span class="g-oversight-authority">Open Data Advisory Board ("ODAB") </span>tasked with creating an overall Open Data program, formulating and incorporating an Open Data Implementation Plan which establishes formal Open Data Policies and mechanisms for implementing Open Data action items.</p>
<p><span class="g-archival-material"><strong>Section 2. Definitions</strong></span> — As used in this Executive Order, the terms below shall have the following definitions:</p>
<p>(A) "Data" <span class="def-data">means and is limited to final versions of statistical or factual, quantitative, or qualitative information that: (1) is in alphanumeric form reflected in a list, table, graph, chart or other non-narrative form, that can be digitally transmitted or processed; and (2) is regularly received, created or maintained by or for a City department, office, administrative unit, commission, board, advisory committee or other subdivision of City government within the official jurisdiction of the Executive Branch; (3) records a measurement, transaction or determination related to the business of the City and mission of such City subdivision; and (4) is inclusive of software source code developed or maintained by or on behalf of the City of Tulsa. <span class="g-archival-material">The term "data" shall not include information provided by other governmental entities or image files, such as designs, drawings, photos or scanned copies of original documents</span>; provided, however, that the term "data" does include statistical or factual information about image files and geographic information system (GIS) data.</span></p>
<p>(B) "Dataset" means a named collection of related data, the aggregation of which contains data organized or formatted in a specific or prescribed way, often in tabular form. Any Open Data made accessible as a Dataset on the City Open Data Portal shall, where feasible: (1) use a format that permits automated processing of such data; (2) use appropriate technology to notify the public of updates to the data; and (3) be accessible to external search capabilities.</p>
<p>(C) <span class="g-open-formats"><span class="g-thoughtful-formats">"Open Format" means any widely accepted, nonproprietary, platform-independent, or machine-readable method for formatting data, which permits automated processing of such data and is accessible to external search capabilities</span></span>.</p>

<p>(E) "Sensitive <span class="g-open-formats"><span class="g-thoughtful-formats">information" means any Data</span></span> or portion of a Dataset, which, if published on the Open Data Portal, could raise privacy, confidentiality or security concerns or have the potential to jeopardize public health, safety or welfare to an extent that is greater than the potential public benefit of publishing that information.</p>
<p>(F) "Open Data" <span class="def-open"><span class="g-open-code">means any Data, which does not contain protected information or sensitive information and </span><span class="g-open-formats"><span class="g-thoughtful-formats">which is <span class="g-open-access"><span class="g-license-free"><span class="g-open-code">made available online in Open Format</span></span>, with no legal encumbrances on use or reuse.</span></span> This definition is inclusive of any software source code made available online ("open source software</span>").

<p>(C) Nothing in this Order shall be construed to create a private right of action to enforce any provision of this Order. Failure to comply with any provision of this Order shall not result in any liability to the City of Tulsa, a municipal corporation.</p>
