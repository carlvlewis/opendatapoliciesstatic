<p>Ordinance amending the Administrative Code to modify open data standards and set deadlines for releasing open data.</p>
<p>Be it ordained by the People of the City and County of San Francisco:</p>
<p>Section 1.  The Administrative Code is hereby amended by revising Chapter 22, Sections 22D.1, 22D.2, and 22D.3, to read as follows:</p>
<p>SEC. 22D.1.  FINDINGS.</p>
<p>(a) An open data policy will provide benefits to the City, which include:</p>
<p>(1) <span class="g-goals-and-values">enhanced government transparency and </span>accountability;</p>
<p>(2) development of new analyses or applications based on the unique data the City provides;</p>
<p>(3) mobilization of San Francisco's high-tech workforce to use City data to create useful civic tools at no cost to the City; and</p>
<p>(4) creation of <span class="g-goals-and-values">social and economic benefits based on innovation in how residents interact with government</span> stemming from increased accessibility to City data sets.</p>
<p>(b) San Francisco has been a leader in open data policy in the United States.  On October 21, 2009, Mayor Newsom issued Executive Directive 09-06, entitled Open Data ("the Directive").  The Directive stated the City's commitment to transparency in government by declaring that all appropriate data sets would be published through a designated website.  The City expanded on the Directive with the enactment of the Open Data Policy (Ordinance 293-10), codified in Chapter 22D of the Administrative Code.  A significant and valuable revision to the Open Data Policy came through the amendment of Chapter 22 establishing the position of Chief Data Officer, Departmental Data Coordinators, and making other procedural revisions (Ordinance No.69-13).</p>
<p>(c)	City departments should continue to take further steps to make their data sets available to the public in a more timely and efficient manner.</p>
<p>(d)	The City should develop a strategy for the release of City-held citizen data directly back to citizens who request such data.</p>
<p>(e) In enacting and implementing this Chapter, the City is assuming an undertaking only to promote the general welfare. It is not assuming, nor is it imposing on its officers and employees, an obligation for breach of which it is liable in money damages to any person who claims that such breach proximately caused injury. </p>
<p>SEC. 22D.2.  CHIEF DATA OFFICER AND CITY DEPARTMENTS.</p>
<p>(a) Chief Data Officer. In order to coordinate implementation, compliance, and expansion of <span class="g-sensitive-information">the City's Open Data Policy</span>, the Mayor shall appoint a Chief Data Officer (CDO) for the City and County of San Francisco</p>
<p>The CDO shall be responsible for drafting rules and <span class="g-binding-regulations">technical standards to implement</span> the open data policy, and determining within the boundaries of law which data sets are appropriate for public disclosure.  In making this determination, the CDO shall balance the benefits of open data set forth in Section 22D.1, with the need to protect from disclosure information that is proprietary or confidential and that may be  protected from disclosure in accordance with law. Nothing in the rules and technical standards shall compel or authorize the disclosure of privileged information, law enforcement information, national security information, personal information, unless required by law.  Nothing in the rules or technical standards shall compel or authorize the disclosure of information  which is prohibited by law.</p>
<p>(b) The CDO’s duties shall include, but are not limited to the following:</p>
<p>(1)  Draft rules and technical standards to <span class="g-future-review">implement the open data polic</span>y ensuring <span class="g-data-portals-and-websites">the policy incorporates the </span>following principles; </p>
