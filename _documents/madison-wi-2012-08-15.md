Whether the data set creates or has the capacity to create economic opportunities;</p> <p>5. Whether the data set responds to any need or demand identified by public consultation, and;</p> <p>6. The accuracy and completeness of the data set, i.e., preliminary, inaccurate or misleading data sets should not be published in order to avoid misleading or confusing the public. Such a determination regarding publication does not foreclose a requesters access to such data sets under either the Wisconsin Public Records Laws (Wis.

Stats. §§ 19.31-19.47) and the Madison Public Records ordinance (Sec. 3.70, MGO).</p> <p>(k) No Release of Data Sets That Would Endanger Safety. In accordance with Wis.
