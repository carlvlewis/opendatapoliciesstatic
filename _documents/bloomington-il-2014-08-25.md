<p>FOR COUNCIL: August 25, 2014</p>
<p>SUBJECT: Website Transparency Policy</p>
<br>
<p><strong>RECOMMENDATION/MOTION:</strong> That the Ordinance be passed.</p>
<p><strong>STRATEGIC PLAN LINK:</strong> Goal 1. Financially sound City providing quality basic services.</p>
<p><strong>STRATEGIC PLAN SIGNIFICANCE:</strong> Objective 1c. Engaged residents that are well informed and involved in an open governance process.</p>
<p><strong>BACKGROUND:</strong> The Illinois Policy Institute has developed a Ten-Point Transparency Checklist to help provide a “best practices” framework to improve government transparency across the State of Illinois. This Checklist encourages the following information to be provided on a public body’s website: (1) Elected  Administrative Officials: Contact Information; (2) Meeting Information: Calendar (Future) Minutes  Board Packets (Past); (3) Public Records: FOIA submission  FOIA Officer Contact Information; (4) Budgets: General and Special Projects; (5) Financial Audits: Comprehensive Annual Financial Reports; (6) Expenditures: Bills  Payroll; (7) Salary  Benefits: Wages, Salary, Overtime, Health, Dental, Life, Pension, etc.; (8) Contracts: Union, Private Contractors, Vendors, Council Contract; (9) Lobbying: TaxpayerFunded Lobbying Associations; and (10) Taxes  Fees: Sales, Property, Income, and Miscellaneous Taxes, Non-proprietary in excess of $25,000.</p>
<p>The City is committed to transparency in the conduct of the public’s business. It should be noted that in 2013, Bloomington was one (1) of only fifty (50) of the nearly 7,000 communities in Illinois to earn the Illinois Policy Institute’s Sunshine Award for outstanding online transparency performance. Upon final audit, Bloomington earned 88.7 points out of 100, an improvement of thirty (30) points over the City’s first audit score, and finished in ninth place overall for web transparency in the State of Illinois.</p>
<p>City staff has modeled a Website Transparency Policy based off the Illinois Policy Institute’s checklist. This Policy was previously reviewed by the Council at a Committee of the Whole meeting at which time there was a desire communicated to have it adopted by Ordinance as opposed by Resolution and to make sure that City staff had sufficient time to implement the changes set forth within the Policy. The Resolution has now been modified into an Ordinance and the Policy itself has been updated to provide further clarification on some of the issues and ensure staff has sufficient time to implement the changes. </p>
<p>As opposed to a September 1, 2014 start date, the Policy now calls for implementation effective October 1, 2014. The new version of the Policy also has a standard five (5) year retention policy for all documents. Clarification within the Policy was also made on the requirement that executed contracts, entered into by the Council on or after October 1, 2014, will be placed on the City’s website. It is staff’s intent that once these contracts are executed by all parties, they will be scanned and placed in the appropriate folder on the website. Older contracts will be scanned and placed on the website as resources allow. The revised Policy also clarifies that information on construction and building permits and application fees, along with written applications, will be available on the website. Other permits, fees and applications will be added and provided as available. </p>
<p>The transparency portal on the City’s website will be updated as a result of this Policy to coordinate with the ten (10) areas it outlines. Links will be provided under each category to obtain the information described within the Policy. A large majority of the information detailed within the Policy is already on the website and in many cases the City will be exceeding the Policy’s written standards. Staff is hopeful that by adding even more information to the website and clarifying where documents can be found, there will be a reduction in FOIA requests.</p>
<p><strong>COMMUNITY GROUPS/INTERESTED PERSONS CONTACTED:</strong> This Policy was drafted based on recommendations from the Illinois Public Policy Institute.</p>
<p><strong>FINANCIAL IMPACT:</strong> Not applicable.</p>
<p>Respectfully submitted for Council consideration.</p>
<p>Prepared by: Jeffrey R. Jurgens, Corporation Counsel</p>
<p>Recommended by: David A. Hales, City Manager</p>
<p>Attachments: Attachment 1. Ordinance Adopting A City Website Transparency Policy</p>
<p>Motion: That the ordinance be passed.</p>
