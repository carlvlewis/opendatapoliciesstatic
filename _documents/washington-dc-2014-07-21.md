<p>Mayor's Order 2014-170</p>
<p>July 21, 2014</p>
<p>By virtue of the authority vested in me as Mayor of the District of Columbia by section 422(2) and (11) of the District of Columbia Home Rule Act, approved December 24, 1973, 87 Stat. 790, Pub. L. No. 93-198, D.C. Official Code § 1-204.22(2) and (11) (2012 Repl.), and section 206 of the District of Columbia Freedom of Information Act, effective March 25, 1977, D.C. Law 1-96, D.C. Official Code § 2-536 (2012 Repl.), it is hereby ORDERED that:</p>
<p> Section 1.  Introduction.</p>
<p>a. Background.  <span class="g-goals-and-values">The District of Columbia government (“District”) is committed to creating an unprecedented level of openness in government.  Agency heads will work together and with the public to ensure public trust, and an open and effective government by establishing a system of transparency, public participation, collaboration, and accountability that increases the public’s confidence in their government. The goal of this directive is to provide a tool for prescribing and institutionalizing change within all departments and agencies.</span></p>
<p>The District has been a leader in government transparency and open data policy in the United States.  In 2001, <span class="g-build-on-precedent">the Freedom of Information Act was amended to require</span> that certain public records be published online.  Since 2006, the District has been making data publicly available on the Internet.  In January 2011, Mayor’s Memorandum 2011-1, entitled Transparency and Open Government Policy, was issued, recognizing that the District government needed to continue to proactively provide <span class="g-build-on-precedent">information to citizens, and t</span>hereby reduce the need for <span class="g-build-on-precedent">information requests.  This directive </span>implements Mayor’s Memorandum 2011-1, to require District government departments and agencies to take the following steps to achieve the goal of creating a more transparent and open government:</p>
<p>b. Definitions.</p>
<p>1) “Chief Data Officer” (“CDO”) means the Chief Technology Officer or a Chief Data Officer designated by the Chief Technology Officer.</p>

<p>3) “Dataset” means a named collection of related records, with the collection containing data organized or formatted in a specific or prescribed way, often in tabular form.</p>
<p>4) “Open Government Coordinator” means agency personnel designated by an agency head, in coordination with the Office of the Chief Technology Officer (“OCTO”) or the CDO as appropriate, to ensure that the information and data required to be published online is published and updated as required by this Order.</p>
<p>5) “<span class="g-build-on-precedent"><span class="g-sensitive-information">Protected data” means (i) any dataset or portion thereof to which an agency may deny access pursuant to the District of Columbia Freedom of Information Act, effective March 25, 1977 (D.C.

Official Code § 2-531 et seq.)(“FOIA”), or any other law or rule or regulation; (ii) any dataset that contains a significant amount of data to which an agency may deny access pursuant to FOIA or any other law or rule or regulation promulgated thereunder, if the removal of such protected data from the dataset would impose an undue financial or administrative burden on the agency; or (iii) any data which, if disclosed on the District of Columbia Data Catalog, could raise privacy, confidentiality or security concerns or jeopardize or have the potential to jeopardize public health, safety or welfare.</span></span></p>
