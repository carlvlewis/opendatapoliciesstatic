OPEN DATA POLICY

## I. PURPOSE

The City of Tempe has established the Tempe Open Data Program to support Tempe’s commitment to expand both the data it makes available to the public and tools for understanding that data, while continuing to protect privacy, confidentiality, and security.

The Tempe Open Data Policy is established in accordance with the City Council Resolution executed on 24 February 2017. This policy defines the principles governing Tempe Open Data and describes the expectations for governance and departmental participation in the Tempe Open Data Program.

## VI. OPEN DATA PROGRAM

### 1. Data as an Asset

A. The City of Tempe and any individuals or groups acting on behalf of the City will proactively make data available through the Open Data Portal subject to the limitations outlined in this policy and the procedures of the Open Data Program.

B. When planning for new systems or data collection projects, or modifying existing systems or processes, City departments and offices shall consider which datasets and associated metadata should be published as Open Data.

C. Whenever technically possible, Open Data shall be published in an open format that is any widely accepted, nonproprietary, platform-independent, machine-readable method for formatting data, which permits automated processing of such data and facilitates analysis and search capabilities (for example, CSV, JSON, XML).

D. Whenever technically possible, provide data in a form appropriate for its use to increase accessibility.

E. Datasets on the Open Data Portal shall be made available without registration
requirement, license requirement or restrictions on their use provided that the
department may require a third party providing to the public any public data set, or application utilizing such data set, to explicitly identify the source and version of the public data set, and a description of any modifications made to such public data set.

F. While a preference is towards making all data public, some data elements if
released, especially in bulk, could cause privacy harms, put critical infrastructure at risk, or put public safety personnel and initiatives at risk. City Departments and Offices should use tools provided by the Open Data Program Handbook to assess risk as part of determining datasets to be released.

G. All published data will be in primary forms, as collected at the source, with a level of disaggregation consistent with law, privacy, and public safety. Only minimal necessary filtering and aggregation will be used to mitigate identified legal, privacy, or public safety issues.

H. The requirements set forth in this policy shall be integrated into the evaluation of new technology or Request for Proposal (RFP) questionnaires and checklists to help facilitate consistent identification and publishing of datasets as the City plans for the implementation of new technologies and systems.

I. The requirements set forth in this policy shall be integrated into contracts with
private companies that facilitate City operations. Unless otherwise stated in the
contract, Tempe has the exclusive right to share, store or dispose of any data
generated or created as part of these contracts. The City will seek to include
standard language in these contracts to ensure these rights.

J. Should the Open Data Program discover that data is being used in ways that violate privacy, puts the public at risk, or contravene the Program’s goals, the City of Tempe and parties acting on its behalf have the right and responsibility to take any action necessary to mitigate these risks.

K. In developing the Open Data Program, the City Manager may, after considering the priority needs and financial resources of the City, request from the City Council additional funds, if necessary, to support the Program and the Portal

### 2. Responsibilities

City Departments and Office Directors shall:

A. Direct department Data Owners to make the department’s data and accompanying metadata available to the public on the City’s Open Data Portal, subject to the limitations outlined in this policy and the operating procedures of the Open Data Program.

B. Direct department Data Owners to ensure that department data made open to the public adheres to the City’s privacy, security, retention and public disclosure
policies and standards.

C. Designate an Open Data Coordinator in each department who shall serve as the point of contact and coordinator for that department’s publishing of Open Data.

D. Annually establish goals for department data to be made open, and make attainment of those goals part of the performance evaluation for the City.

E. Work with the Open Data Team to assess performance and attainment of the Open Data Program’s goals.

### 3. Institutionalizing the Open Data Program

In partnership with the Open Data Team and coordinated by their Open Data
Coordinator, each City Department and Office shall:

A. Work with the Open Data Team to publish data sets classified as “public” and that have been prioritized for public disclosure. Prior to publication, each Department shall ensure that data is published with at least minimum relevant documentation, adheres to applicable rules of the Tempe Open Data Handbook, and follows - if possible, practical and available - commonly used standards for that type of data.

B. Presume that data it creates, collects or maintains--including data created, collected, or maintained on the department’s behalf through contract with a third party--shall be made open to the public subject to the limitations set forth in the City’s open data, privacy, security, retention and disclosure policies and standards.

C. Establish processes to identify which datasets should be published on the Open Data Portal, assess potential privacy risks, and streamline the routine publication of that data in the most open format possible, consistent with the City’s privacy and security policies.

D. Develop a data inventory detailing the Department’s data holdings, which further identifies and prioritizes datasets to be made public, while setting specific goals and timelines for the publication of datasets as Open Data. Department data inventories shall be combined into a master Tempe data catalog, which shall be made publicly viewable.

E. Make data and accompanying metadata open in a machine-readable form that adheres to metadata guidelines provided in the Tempe Open Data Handbook. This will allow the Open Data Program to increase discoverability and facilitate successful use of the data.

F. Make datasets published to the Open Data Portal available to the public on an open license basis. An open license on a dataset signifies there are no restrictions on copying, publishing, further distributing, modifying or using the data for a noncommercial or commercial purpose.

G. Provide a citation format appropriate to each dataset published based on guidance contained in the Open Data Handbook.

H. Ensure that data and metadata made open to the public is accurate, updated and well documented. Data and metadata shall be updated as often as is necessary to preserve the integrity and usefulness of the data set.

I. With input from stakeholders such as boards, commissions, and community
members, develop a prioritized list of existing datasets to be made open.

J. Work with the Open Data Team to set appropriately ambitious timelines for the publication of datasets.
