<span class="g-proactive-release">If an agency cannot make all such public data sets available on the single web portal, the agency shall <span class="g-oversight-authority">report to the Office of the Governor</span> the public data set or sets it is unable to make available, the reasons why it cannot do so, and the date by which the agency expects those data sets to be available on the single web portal.</span>

The technical standards shall be determined by the Office of the Governor, in consultation with the subject matter experts from all State agencies and representatives of units of local government, not-for-profit organizations specializing in technology and innovation, the academic community, and other interested groups as designated by the Office of the Governor.

1. Public data sets shall be provided in a format that permits public notification of all updates whenever possible.
