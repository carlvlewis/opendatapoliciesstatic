## Open Data Policy – Implementation Plan

Open Data Policy implementation activities are described in more detail in the following sections. Terms
that are defined in the Open Data Policy shall have the same meaning in this Implementation Plan.

## 1.0 Starting the clock

The Open Data Policy (Policy) will become effective on the date upon which the Resolution authorizing
the Policy takes effect (Effective Date). The Policy requires activities to occur within a certain number of
days of its effective date. The Economic Development and Intergovernmental Relations Committee
unanimously forwarded the Policy to the full City Council (Council) on July 2, 2014. Council is expected
to consider the Policy in December. For purposes of developing this implementation plan, the Policy’s
Effective Date is assumed to be no later than January 1, 2015.

## 2.0 Selecting the Chief Data Officer

Many cities with open data policies have found filling the position of CDO to be an important step in
legitimizing the open data effort. There is no “one size fits all” approach to filling the position of CDO.

Examples of effective CDOs can come from a more internally/service-focused background or,
alternatively, a more externally/community-focused approach. If it is the right person, either model can
work. However, in either case, it is essential that the individual has a direct connection to the top – an
executive champion who is committed and has the organizational strength to push the open data
initiative. The individual selected should have a familiarity and comfort level with the technology
involved in open data programs, but the position is not just a technical position. It is important that the
individual be committed to the initiative and able to articulate a compelling vision of the benefits of the
program.

Starting in Fiscal Year 2015, the Chief Data Officer (CDO) is a program manager position in the
Performance and Analytics Department. To support hiring the CDO as quickly as possible, the position
description and applicable paperwork were completed in June 2014. Out of 46 applicants, 15
candidates were selected for interview. An initial offer was made in September, and the Chief Data
Officer’s start date is November 24, 2014.

## 3.0 Developing guidelines for preparing an inventory of data

Within his or her first four months of duty, the CDO will prepare written guidelines that describe how to
prepare an inventory of Data Sets (Inventory Guidelines). The CDO will identify Open Data
representatives from all City departments and consult with them while preparing the Inventory
Guidelines. The CDO will release the guidelines by March 31, 2015.

## 4.0 Developing initial inventory of data

Upon issuance of the guidelines on preparing data inventories, each City department will assemble an
initial inventory of data owned or managed by the department. The CDO will compile all of the initial
inventory inputs into a report on Public Data Sets (as defined in the Policy) to be published no later than
the earlier of 120 days after the issuance of the guidelines, or July 1, 2015.

## 5.0 Developing and issuing Technical Guidelines

After issuing the Inventory Guidelines and while the departments are working on their initial inventories,
the CDO will develop and issue Technical Guidelines for the publishing of Public Data Sets through a web
portal, for the purpose of making Public Data Sets available to the greatest number of users and for the
greatest number of applications and shall, whenever practicable, use Voluntary Compliance Standards
for web publishing and e-government. The CDO will issue the Technical Guidelines no later than July 1,
2015.

## 6.0 Developing written Status Report

Within 180 days of the Effective Date (or by July 1, 2015), the CDO shall submit a written status report
to the Mayor and the Council and shall make such report available to the public on the City web site.

The CDO shall provide an updated status report to the appropriate City Council committee within 12
months of the Effective Date and annually thereafter.

## 7.0 Preparing a Data Portal and Making Public Data Sets available

The CDO will work with the Purchasing & Contracting Department to determine the procurement
approach for obtaining the services of a data portal provider. This may involve developing a
Statement of Work to be included in a Request for Proposals, or it may involve a more streamlined
procurement approach.

Within 18 months of the Policy Effective Date, or by July 1, 2016, the City will begin to publish high
value Public Data Sets to its portal.

## 8.0 Developing Compliance Plan

Within 18 months of the Effective Date (or by July 1, 2016), the CDO shall submit a Compliance Plan to
the Mayor and the Council and shall make such plan available to the public on the City web site. The
plan shall include an inventory and a summary description of Public Data Sets under the control of
each City department and also include a timeline for publication to the web portal of high value
existing Public Data Sets, as determined by the CDO with input from the public, with all
high value Public Data Sets being published within five years of the Effective Date of this Policy. If a
Public Data Set cannot be made available on the web portal within the specified time, the plan shall
state the reasons why such high value Public Data Set cannot be made available, and, to the extent
practicable, the date by which the City department that owns the data believes that it will be
available on the web portal.

Annually following the first publication of the Compliance Plan, the CDO shall post on the web portal
an update of the Compliance P lan, until all Public Data Sets have been made available through a
single web portal. These updates of the Compliance Plan will be published annually on July 1.
