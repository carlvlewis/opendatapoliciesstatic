Therefore, the Unified Government will make datasets publicly available for review, interpretation, analysis and research.</span>


DIRECTIVE

<span class="g-data-portals-and-websites">Unified Government departments will work in cooperation with the Open Data Committee as outlined in this Administrative Order to make datasets publicly available on the UG Open Data portal.</span>

DATA STANDARDS

<span class="g-build-on-precedent"><span class="g-open-access">In an effort to promote the interoperability between information systems and the release of data to the public in a way that promotes maximal access to data, departments will strive to incorporate the following standards into data collection;</span></span>

<span class="g-open-formats"><span class="g-thoughtful-formats">Machine readability: Data shall be collected and released in machine readable, open formats based on common data standards, that allow for automated processing</span></span>

<span class="g-open-formats"><span class="g-thoughtful-formats"><span class="g-bulk-data"><span class="g-real-time-updates"><span class="g-data-quality">Data quality: Datasets shall be complete and available in a timely manner (with the ultimate goal of real-time data release), and when possible should be available for bulk download.</span></span></span></span></span>

<span class="g-license-free">License-free: When possible Data will be made available at no cost and using an open license, with no restrictions on copying, publishing, distributing, transmitting, or adapting the information.

<span class="def-open">Open Data: Data made open and freely available online to the public to be republished, manipulated, or used in any other way without restriction.</span>
