RESOLUTION NO.   (N.C.S.)

A RESOLUTION OF THE CITY OF SALINAS ESTABLISHING AN OPEN DATA POLICY

WHEREAS, much of the data collected by the City of Salinas (hereafter, “the City”) is stored in ways which impede the ability to aggregate, analyze and synthesize it to better allocate public resources in an equitable manner; and

<span class="g-goals-and-values">WHEREAS, access to public information promotes a higher level of civic engagement and makes it easier for interested individuals to provide valuable feedback to City officials regarding local issues; and</span>

WHEREAS, everyone should receive prompt, efficient service from the City; and

<span class="g-build-on-precedent">WHEREAS, the thoughtful implementation of an open data program improves provision of services, increases transparency and access to public information, and enhances coordination and efficiencies among departments, partner organizations, and residents; and</span>

WHEREAS, one goal of an Open Data policy is to proactively provide information currently sought through requests for public records, thereby saving the City time and money; and

<span class="g-proactive-release">WHEREAS, in commitment to the spirit of Open Government, the City will consider public information to be open by default and will proactively publish data and data containing information, consistent with relevant public records law; and</span>

<span class="g-public-apis">WHEREAS, information technologies, including web-based and other Internet applications and services, are an essential means for Open Government, and good government generally; and</span>

WHEREAS, by publishing structured standardized data in machine readable formats the City seeks to encourage the local software community to develop software applications and tools to collect, organize, and share public records data in new and innovative ways; and

WHEREAS, the publishing of data provides benefits to the business community to produce tools and products with data that might better serve the public; and

<span class="g-sensitive-information">WHEREAS, the protection of privacy, confidentiality and security will be maintained as a paramount priority while also advancing the City's transparency and accountability through open data; and</span>

WHEREAS, the Open Data Policy supports all five elements of the 2016-19 City of Salinas Strategic Plan; and

WHEREAS, The City of Salinas has determined that the proposed action is not a project as defined by the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) (CEQA Guidelines Section 15378). In addition, CEQA Guidelines Section 15061 includes the general rule that CEQA applies only to activities which have the potential for causing a significant effect on the environment. Where it can be seen with certainty that there is no possibility that the activity in question may have a significant effect on the environment, the activity is not subject to CEQA. Because the proposed action and this matter have no potential to cause any effect on the environment, or because it falls within a category of activities excluded as projects pursuant to CEQA Guidelines section 15378, this matter is not a project. Because the matter does not cause a direct or foreseeable indirect physical change on or in the environment, this matter is not a project. Any subsequent discretionary projects resulting from this action will be assessed for CEQA applicability.

NOW THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE CITY COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF SALINAS AS FOLLOWS:

## Section 1. The above recitals are true and correct.

## Section 2. The Open Data Policy is defined as follows:

### ARTICLE I DEFINITIONS

a. <span class="def-data">“Data” means statistical, factual, quantitative, or qualitative information that is maintained or created by or on behalf of a city agency. This definition is inclusive of software source code developed or maintained by or on behalf of the City.</span>

b. <span class="def-open">“Open data” means data that is available online, in an open format, with no legal encumbrances on use or reuse, and is available for all to access and download in bulk without fees or a requirement of registration. “Legal encumbrance” includes copyright protections and other, non-statutory legal limitations on how or under what conditions a dataset may be used. This definition is also inclusive of any software source code made available online (“open source software”).</span>

c. “Open format” means any widely accepted, nonproprietary, platform-independent, machine-readable data format, which permits automated processing of such data and facilitates analysis and search capabilities.

d. “Dataset” means a named collection of related records, with the collection containing data organized or formatted in a specific or prescribed way, often in tabular form.

e. “Protected information” means any dataset or portion thereof to which an agency may deny access pursuant to applicable law or any other rule or regulation.

f. “Sensitive information” means any data that, if published by the City, could raise privacy, confidentiality or security concerns or have the potential to jeopardize public health, safety or welfare to an extent that is greater than the potential public benefit of publishing that data.

g. <span class="def-public">“Publishable data” means data which is not protected or sensitive and which has been prepared for release to the public.</span>

h. “Metadata” means a set of data that describes and gives information about other data. It can include elements such as title, abstract, author, and keywords. It can also include system metadata, which defines the data structures such as tables, fields, data types, indexes and partitions, as well as databases, dimensions, measures, and data mining models.

Published datasets shall be placed into the public domain. Dedicating datasets to the public domain means that there are no restrictions or requirements placed on use of these datasets.

Each published dataset should be associated with contact information for the appropriate manager of that dataset as well as with a file layout or data dictionary that provides information about field labels and values.

<span class="g-citations">City departments will specify a recommended data citation form available for viewing on the central online location for published city data to encourage responsible reuse of city data.</span>
