## Exhibit A: Open Data Principles

The City of Austin is committed to fostering open, transparent, and accessible city government, and recognizes that by sharing data freely, the city will generate opportunities for economic development, commerce, and civic engagements for citizens. The city also recognizes that the adoption of open government data standards, and providing timely access to city data, will improve transparency, public access to information, and coordination between city entities and the private sector.

1. The rules and standards for publication of data sets shall be consistent with applicable law, including laws related to privacy and accessibility.
2. To the extent practicable and consistent with applicable law and policy, each City department or other entity ("Department") shall make reasonable efforts to make available for publication all data sets under the Department's control in an open format that is platform independent, machine readable, and made available to the public without restrictions that impede the re-use of that information.
3. All published data sets shall be in primary forms, as collected at the source, with a level of granularity consistent with law, privacy, and public safety. Only minimal necessary filtering and aggregation will be used to mitigate identified legal, privacy, or public safety issues.
4. All published data sets shall be made available and updated as often as necessary to preserve the integrity and usefulness of the data sets.
5. To the extent feasible, published data sets shall be presented and structured in a format that permits automated processing.
6. To the maximum extent allowed by law, published data sets shall be made available without any registration requirement, license requirement, or restrictions on their use.
7. All public data sets shall be made available with the descriptive information needed to understand what the data are, and how and when they were collected.
