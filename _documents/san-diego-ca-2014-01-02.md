WHEREAS, the City of San Diego is committed to open, transparent, and accessible

WHEREAS, Open Data is defined as data produced or commissioned by government that
can be easily and freely used, reused and redistributed by anyone, for any purpose; and

WHEREAS, Open Data can be used for various purposes, including enabling
participatory govemance, as a means of ensuring transparency, and as a catalyst for economic
development; and

consistent with residents' right to public information, and promotes engagement with the
potential benefit of civic development of technology products and infrastmcture to improve
service delivery through expanded and innovative applications, among other things; and

WHEREAS, by creating an Open Data policy, the City of San Diego seeks to develop
opportunities for civic engagement, economic development, commerce, and increased
investment; and

WHEREAS, an Open Data policy must include a robust cyber security element to reduce
the potential for cyber attacks; and

WHEREAS, open and accessible data must be delicately balanced with privacy
protections for the City and its citizens to reduce legal risk to the City of San Diego; and

WHEREAS, making data open and accessible must be done in a manner that satisfies the
legal requirements contained in any software license or other legally binding agreement to which
the City is a party; and

WHEREAS, valuable infonnation pertaining to Open Data was presented to the Rules
and Economic Development Committee (now the Economic Development and
Intergovemmental Relations Committee) by both Code for America and the Office of the
Independent Budget Analyst; and

WHEREAS, while an Open Data policy has the potential to benefit the community and
consideration must be given to how to equitably bridge the "digital divide" for the greatest
number of citizens; and

WHEREAS, the Independent Budget Analyst noted that the potential benefits associated
with Open Data will need to be weighed against the potential public benefits of open government
strategies; and

WHEREAS, one goal of an Open Data policy is to decrease the number of Public
Records Act requests submitted to various City departments as public infonnation is more
readily accessible; and

WHEREAS, the use of Open Data exchange standards improves transparency, access to
public information, and improved coordination and efficiencies among organizations across the
public, non-profit and private sectors, including within internal city departments; NOW THEREFORE,

BE IT RESOLVED, that the City Council of the City of San Diego supports the creation
of an Open Data policy.
