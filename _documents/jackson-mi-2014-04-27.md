ARTICLE IV. - OPEN DATA AND PUBLIC RECORDS POLICY

Editor's note— Ord. No. 2014-14, § 1, adopted May 27, 2014, effective June 26, 2014, amended Art. IV in its entirety to read as herein set out. Former Art. IV, §§ 2-446—2-450, pertained to public records, and derived from Code 1977, §§ 1.214—1.217, 1.222.


## Sec. 2-446. - Findings and purpose.

Whereas the city creates and retains a large array of data; and

Whereas the city council recognizes this information as a community asset and desires a more proactive stance regarding appropriate dissemination thereof; and

<span class="g-goals-and-values">Whereas by fostering civic engagement through data sharing between city agencies, citizens, businesses, and other community organizations, the city council hopes to use data to improve coordination, collaboration, and efficiency with public stakeholders; and</span>

<span class="g-goals-and-values">Whereas data is a valuable asset to private entities, the city council wants to encourage businesses and other citizen enterprises to make use of government data in ways that will promote economic development and increased local investment; and</span>

<span class="g-goals-and-values">Whereas governmental decisions are influenced by the analysis of specific data it is imperative that the city council offer enhanced access in order to improve transparency and efficiency of review; and</span>

<span class="g-goals-and-values">Whereas no City in Michigan or any American city with a population under </span>one hundred thousand (<span class="g-goals-and-values">100,000) has an open data policy, the city council wishes to become a flagship for transparency and leader among peer cities in terms of data sharing; and</span>

<span class="g-goals-and-values">Whereas the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) affords citizens a way to request information from their government, the city council recognizes that proactively providing information potentially reduces administrative and financial costs associated with Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) compliance;</span>

<span class="g-goals-and-values">The City of Jackson now finds that adopting an open data policy fosters greater transparency and accountability in city affairs. Data and records are collected and curated as described in the sections below.</span>
