<p>Open Data Policy</p>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Arlington Data is the County’s formal open data program that provides direct access to and easy use of County government data.  <span class="g-public-apis">The County uses Application Programming Interfaces (API) that allow for users to access and consume data in a convenient, consistent, secure and orderly fashion.</span> <span class="g-build-on-precedent">The County is constantly expanding its publication of datasets to further its goals of transparency and accountability.</span>  <span class="g-goals-and-values">These open data sets will create opportunities to visualize the data from many perspectives and for various innovative purposes.</span></p>
<h2>Goal</h2>
<p><span class="g-open-formats">Arlington County Government strives to make its data available online using open standards.</span> <span class="g-build-on-precedent">Adhering to open standards will ensure that County data is easily available and consumable; and thus further increases the transparency of County operations, holds the County more accountable to the public, and builds greater confidence in government. </span>This effort will also streamline intra-governmental and inter-governmental communication and interoperability; allow individuals to assist in identifying efficient solutions for government; promote innovative strategies for social progress; and create economic opportunities.</p>
