<p>Open Data Policy</p>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Arlington Data is the County’s formal open data program that provides direct access to and easy use of County government data.  The County uses Application Programming Interfaces (API) that allow for users to access and consume data in a convenient, consistent, secure and orderly fashion. The County is constantly expanding its publication of datasets to further its goals of transparency and accountability.  These open data sets will create opportunities to visualize the data from many perspectives and for various innovative purposes.</p>
<h2>Goal</h2>
<p>Arlington County Government strives to make its data available online using open standards. Adhering to open standards will ensure that County data is easily available and consumable; and thus further increases the transparency of County operations, holds the County more accountable to the public, and builds greater confidence in government. This effort will also streamline intra-governmental and inter-governmental communication and interoperability; allow individuals to assist in identifying efficient solutions for government; promote innovative strategies for social progress; and create economic opportunities.</p>
<h2>Open Data Definition</h2>
