- treating data as a valuable resource;
- making open data available, understandable and relatable for the public;
- protecting data that must be kept secure and private according to federal, state and local laws;
- ensuring that the City’s data practices respect the priorities and interests of the whole community.  

*Q. Who owns this policy?*

A. The City of Boston’s Chief Information Officer (CIO) and whomever the CIO designates is responsible and manages this policy.

*Q. What data is covered by this policy?*

A. For the purposes of this policy, data is defined as geospatial, tabular, textual, legislative and source code that is maintained in an electronic, digital or optical format. This policy covers any data produced or received by any department in the City of Boston.

### 1.1 Principles

This Data Policy is intended to reflect and support the same principles and purposes underlying the Executive Order namely:

- The City of Boston recognizes Open Government as a key means for enabling public participation, transparency, collaboration and effective government, including by ensuring the availability and use of Open Data, appropriate security and sharing of Protected Data, effective use of Identity and Access Management and engagement of stakeholders and experts toward the achievement of Open Government; and
- It is the policy of the City of Boston to practice Open Government, favoring participation, transparency, collaboration and engagement with the people of the City and its stakeholders; and
- Information technologies, including web-based and other Internet applications and services, are an essential means for Open Government, and good government generally; and
- The City of Boston should continue, expand and deepen the City’s innovative use of information technology toward the end of Open Government, including development and use of mobile computing and applications, provision of online data, services and transactions; and
- The City of Boston also has an obligation to protect some data based upon privacy, confidentiality and other requirements and must ensure that protected data not be released in violation of applicable constraints; and
- Clarification and definition of open data, privacy, security requirements, interoperability and interaction flows is necessary for the City’s Open Government agenda.

### 1.2  Incorporation by Reference

The City of Boston Data Policy uses "Incorporation by Reference" to avoid duplication and connect content in a modular, extensible manner.  Content may be Incorporated by Reference from External Content or from other sections internal to the Data Policy.  

When the Data Policy explicitly identifies External Content by it's name and URL as “Incorporated by Reference”, then that content shall have the same force and effect as if it had been published directly in the City of Boston Data Policy.

External content Incorporated by Reference is intended to provide additional relevant information and augmenting details that are consistent with the Data Policy. The terms of the City of Boston Data Policy shall prevail and supersede any materially inconsistent or directly conflicting terms of content Incorporated by Reference.

### 1.3 Policy Authorization

The City of Boston Data Policy is issued pursuant to the Executive Order promulgated by Mayor Martin J. Walsh on April 7th, 2014.  That order authorizes and directs the Chief Information Officer (CIO) to issue and maintain policies covering Open Data and Protected Data including Identity and Access Management guidelines for Sharing Protected Data.  

### 1.4 Definition of Data

Data is to be treated as an important resource of the City of Boston and its constituents for strategic and operational purposes, among others. For the purposes of this policy, data is defined as geospatial, tabular, textual, legislative and source code that is maintained in an electronic, digital or optical format.  

### 1.5 Policy Construction and Interpretation

Nothing in this Data Policy shall be construed to diminish or alter the rights or obligations afforded under the Massachusetts Public Records Law, Chapter 66, Section 10 of the Massachusetts General Laws and the exemptions under Chapter 4, Section 7(26).  Additionally, this Data Policy is intended to be interpreted consistent with Federal, Commonwealth, and local laws and regulations regarding the privacy, confidentiality, and security of data.  Nothing herein shall authorize the disclosure of data that is exempt, for reasons such as confidentiality or privacy, or otherwise legally protected unless such disclosure is authorized by law and approved by the Corporation Counsel of the City of Boston.

## 2.0 Data Management

*Q. How is data indexed?*

A. The City will maintain a Data Catalog, which serves as a registry of the City’s data sets and includes key information documentation about the data, including whether it is considered Public Record.

*Q. What is Data Classification?*

A. Data Classification is the process of determining which data sets are Public Records and which sets are Exempt Records according to Chapter 66, Section 10 and Chapter 4, Section 7(26) of Massachusetts General Laws.  

*Q. What is a Data Classification Label?*

A. A Data Classification Label is the quick way to check if any restrictions apply to disclosure or use of data.  There are two main labels: The "Public Record" or "Exempt Record" labels. A label may change over time due to changes in law, the use of analytics or the combination of other data, for example.   

*Q. Does a Data Classification Label change?*

A.  How a specific data set is labeled may change for a number of reasons including a change to law or new data analysis.  For example, data that, itself, may not contain personally identifiable information may reveal such information when combined with other data sets.  

*Q. Who has rights to data generated through a private contract?*

A. The City has numerous contracts with private companies to facilitate City operations such as applying for building permits..  Unless specified otherwise in a contract, the City of Boston has the exclusive right to share, store or dispose of data created through these contracts.  The City will seek to include standard language in all contracts that ensure these rights.  

### 2.1 Data Catalog

To manage the City’s data, the Chief Information Officer and the CIO’s designee shall establish and maintain a Data Catalog.  That data catalog will be a register of data sets, including information such as their location, description, classification, custodianship, security controls or other stipulations, where applicable.  

### 2.2 Data Classification

Data of the City of Boston will be classified as a either a Public Record or an Exempt Record according to Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 66, Section 10 and Chapter 4, Section 7(26) . The CIO will work with the City’s Law Department and the relevant departments who are closest to each data set to conduct this data classification.  The data sets will be labeled in the Data Catalog according to their classification. 

### 2.3 Impact of Data Analysis & Data Science

The CIO or the CIO’s designee will regularly review the catalog and work with the relevant Departments to ensure that classifications labels are appropriately up to date.  The classification of data as an Exempt Record or as a Public Record may change after analytics or other computational processing are conducted on data. 

### 2.4 Rights to Share, Store and Dispose of Data

In some cases, the City will enter into contracts with third parties for the provision of public services, through which new data will be generated.  In these cases, the City’s default position is that the City - and not third party acting on behalf of the City - has the exclusive right to share, store or dispose of data, to the extent allowed by law.   

The City of Boston Model Data Contract, which is hereby Incorporated by Reference, includes specific standard contract language.
