SENATE COMMITTEE SUBSTITUTE FOR SENATE, No. 727

STATE OF NEW JERSEY

217th LEGISLATURE

ADOPTED MAY 23, 2016

SYNOPSIS: “New Jersey Open Data Initiative” to require certain information be provided on Internet to public and State agencies.

CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT: As reported by the Assembly State and Local Government Committee on September 19, 2016, with amendments.

<br>

AN ACT requiring that certain information be provided on the
Internet to the public and to State departments and agencies, and
supplementing Title 52 of the Revised Statutes.

BE IT ENACTED by the Senate and General Assembly of the State
of New Jersey:

<br>

**1\.** This act shall be known and may be cited as the “New Jersey
Open Data Initiative.”

<br>

**2\.** The Legislature finds and declares:

a. It is in the interest of this State to increase public awareness of and access to the data created by and available from State agencies because such data can enhance transparency and accountability, encourage public engagement, and stimulate public policy and public service innovation;

b. The data generated by the Executive Branch of State government can spur economic development because it enables private sector companies to use such data to produce innovative and creative items and services that benefit the citizens of this State;

c. The efficient integration, management, and governance of data will greatly improve State government programs and the delivery of a wide range of services to New Jersey’s citizens, thereby enhancing their lives.

d. At the same time, it is vitally important that the data held by
one State agency be made readily available to other State agencies
with a minimum of administrative hurdles, so that data shared
across the Executive Branch contribute to the
effective and cost-efficient delivery of a wide range of government
information and services; and

e. The Office of Information Technology, with the cooperation
of the Department of the Treasury, is the appropriate agency to
develop, coordinate, and oversee the presentation of government
data to the public and the sharing of information among State
government agencies so that the information and services those
agencies provide can be delivered in the most efficient and cost-
effective manner possible.

<br>

**3\.** As used in this act:

“Agency” means any of the principal departments of the
Executive Branch, including the Department of the Treasury, and
any division, office, board, bureau, commission, authority or entity
therein or allocated thereto to comply with the provisions of Article
V, Section IV, paragraph 1 of the New Jersey Constitution.

“Data” means final versions of statistical or factual information
in alphanumeric form, in as granular form as possible, and reflected
in a list, table, graph, chart, map, or other non-narrative form that
can be digitally transmitted or processed, and regularly created or
maintained by or on behalf of and owned by a State department or
agency that records a measurement, transaction, or determination
related to the mission of that State department or agency.

“Dataset” means a named collection of related, digitally-stored
data with the collection containing individual data units organized
or formatted in a specific and prescribed way, often in tabular form,
and accessed by a specific access method that is based on the
dataset organization, but not including any data that is protected
from disclosure under applicable federal or State law.

“Open data” means data that is collected by an agency that is not
prohibited from being made available to the public or another State
agency by applicable laws, rules, regulations, policies, or other
restrictions, requirements or rights associated with such data,
including, but not limited to, contractual or other legal orders,
restrictions or requirements.

“Open data website” means either the unique, dedicated open
data website implemented by the Chief Data Officer or an agency’s
website upon which open datasets are hosted.

<br>

**4\.** a. A Chief Data Officer shall be appointed by the Chief
Technology Officer, after consultation with the State Treasurer.

The Chief Data Officer, in cooperation with the State Treasurer,
shall be responsible for overseeing and implementing a
unique, dedicated open data website
and any additional or existing open data websites linked thereto by
an agency. The Chief Data Officer shall have the authority to:

(1) establish, in consultation with the Attorney General,
procedures, standards, and best practices regarding the appropriate
access and presentation of open data and datasets by each agency;

(2) develop a dataset format standard to be used by all agencies
in providing their datasets to the Chief Data Officer, or in making
their data available on their own websites, and ensure that under the
standard, the datasets shall be accessible in a non-proprietary,
machine-readable format that is compliant
with federal and State accessibility rules and requirements and
implemented on a schedule deemed appropriate by the Chief Data
Officer;

(3) monitor and ensure compliance with the procedures,
standards, and policies adopted pursuant to this act;

(4) provide such management and technical assistance as the
Chief Data Officer deems necessary to ensure that there is ready
access to the open data and datasets available to the public and
agencies; and

(5) develop, in conjunction with the Attorney General, a
methodology to review and reconcile inter-agency disputes
regarding access to open data and datasets, and privacy issues.

b. The Chief Data Officer, with the cooperation of the State
Treasurer, shall be responsible for:

(1) creating and maintaining a unique, dedicated website that
either provides datasets maintained and provided by agencies or
searchable links to datasets hosted by agency websites;

(2) updating datasets and links as they are provided by an
agency; and

(3) monitoring agency websites to make certain they follow the
policies and procedures established by the Chief Data Officer
pursuant to this section.

The State Treasurer and an agency may, pursuant to the
“Administrative Procedure Act,” P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et
seq.), adopt such rules and regulations as may be deemed necessary
to effectuate the purposes of this act.

<br>

**5\.** a. Each agency shall either provide datasets to the Chief
Data Officer, in a format determined thereby pursuant to section 4
of P.L. , c. (C. )(pending before the Legislature as
this bill), or create and maintain on the agency’s website links to the
datasets hosted by the agency. Agencies that choose to host their
open datasets on their own websites shall provide links to the Chief
Data Officer for publication thereof on the dedicated website
maintained for that purpose by that officer.

b. Each agency shall adopt policies that are consistent with the
open data security and technical standards, policies, and practices
established by the Chief Data Officer pursuant to section 4 of
P.L. , c. (C. )(pending before the Legislature as this
bill) that govern access to open data and datasets available on the
open data website of the agency. In addition, each agency shall:

(1) create, maintain, and post or have posted on the
open data website an inventory of all its open data and datasets
pursuant to the standards and timetables established by the Chief
Data Officer;

(2) include on the open data website appropriate explanations
about the open data, its format, how often the open data and
datasets are updated, and how notice regarding such updates can be
obtained; and

(3) assist users to gain access to the open data and datasets of
the agency through the deployment of online access tools, and the
development and publication of application program interfaces.

Each agency shall update the open data and datasets on the
timetable and in the manner determined by the Chief Data Officer
to effectuate the purposes of this act.

Unless a fee is required by law, open datasets shall be provided
to the public by an agency without cost to the public.

A dataset that is licensed to the State by a person that is not an
employee thereof or by an entity that is not a public entity shall not
be made available to the public on the open data website
until the dataset has been reviewed by the Attorney
General pursuant to guidelines established thereby, and the person
or entity licensing the data agrees to the public disclosure and to the
form of such disclosure.

All open data and datasets shall be consistent with applicable
law, including P.L.1963, c.73 (C.47:1A-1 et seq.), commonly
known as the open public records act, and other State and federal
laws related to information security and privacy. The open data and
datasets made available by an agency on the open data
website shall not include data that is not subject to public disclosure
under such laws.

Open data and datasets made available by an agency on the
open data website, unless subject to a disclosed legal
restriction, shall be treated as license-free, subject to reuse, and not
subject to copyright restrictions.

Unless specifically prohibited by a contract, open data and
datasets containing data created or maintained by a contractor under
contract to, or licensed from, an agency shall be made available on
the open data website. Each
such contract shall be subject to the provisions of this act and any
applicable federal and State law, including but not limited to,
P.L.1963, c.73 (C.47:1A-1 et seq.), known commonly as the open
public records act.

<br>

**6\.** An agency shall not warrant the fitness for any particular
purpose of any open data or datasets presented on the open data
website, nor shall an agency providing open data
or a dataset on the
open data website be liable for any
deficiencies in its completeness or accuracy, except when the
agency’s conduct would constitute gross negligence, willful and
wanton misconduct, or intentional misconduct.

Each agency, pursuant to standards and policies established by
the Chief Data Officer with the cooperation of the State Treasurer,
shall verify the accuracy of the open data and datasets it makes
available to the public on
open data website and, if
possible, correct any errors or inaccuracies discovered by the
agency providing the open data or dataset, other agencies, or the
public.

Nothing in this section shall require an agency to make its open
data and datasets available to the public on
open data
website upon the demand of the public. Requests for open data or
datasets not posted on the
open data website are subject to potential disclosure under P.L.1963, c.73
(C.47:1A-1 et seq.), known commonly as the open public records
act.

Unless contrary to specific policies or rules established by the
Chief Data Officer, agencies shall not require a user of an open data
website to register or provide any user information as a condition to
obtaining the open data or datasets
provided by the agency on
open data website.

Notwithstanding any rule, regulation or statute to the
contrary, agencies shall be actively encouraged by the Chief Data
Officer and the State Treasurer to share open data and datasets with
each other without formal agreements, provided that no existing
laws regarding the security of personal, private, and confidential
information are violated. The sharing of personal, private, or
confidential data shall be permitted only when in conformity with
restrictions, established by the Chief Data Officer in cooperation
with the Attorney General, to ensure that the data is used in a
manner that is secure and in conformity with State law.

<br>

**7\.** Nothing in P.L. , c. (C. )(pending before the
Legislature as this bill) shall be construed as superseding the
provisions of P.L.1963, c.73 (C.47:1A-1 et seq.), known commonly
as the open public records act.

<br>

**8\.** On the first day of the 24th month following the date of
enactment of this act, P.L. , c. (C. )(pending before
the Legislature as this bill), the Chief Technology Officer, after
consultation with the State Treasurer, shall submit a written report
to the Governor and, pursuant to section 2 of P.L.1991, c.164
(C.52:14-19.1), to the Legislature discussing: a) the progress made
on the implementation of the act; b) the act’s effectiveness in
providing open data and datasets to the public and among agencies
compared with the providing and sharing of such data before the
enactment of the act; c) the feasibility of requiring the Legislative
and Judicial Branches to make open data and datasets available to
the public and other agencies; and d) such other items as the Chief
Technology Officer or the State Treasurer deems necessary. The
report may include any recommendations for changes made by the
Chief Technology Officer or the State Treasurer to P.L. ,
c. (C. )(pending before the Legislature as this bill) or
related sections of current law.

<br>

**9\.** This act shall take effect on the 90th day following the date
of enactment. An agency may take such anticipatory administrative
action in advance of the effective date as may be necessary for the
implementation of the act.
