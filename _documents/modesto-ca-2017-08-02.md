Policy on Open Data for the City of Modesto

## Section 1: Definitions

a. <span class="def-data">“Data” means statistical, factual, quantitative, or qualitative information that is maintained or created by or on behalf of a City agency. This definition is inclusive of software source code developed or maintained by or on behalf of the City.</span>

b. <span class="def-open">“Open data” means data that is available online, in an open format, with no legal encumbrances on use or reuse, and is available for all to access and download in full without fees or a requirement of registration. “Legal encumbrance” includes federal copyright protections, federal and state trademark protections, and other, non-statutory legal limitations on how or under what conditions a dataset ma be used. This definition is also inclusive of any software source code made available online (“open source software”).</span>

c. “Open format” means any widely accepted, nonproprietary, platform-independent, machinereadable data format, which permits automated processing of such data and facilitates analysis and search capabilities.

d. “Dataset” means a named collection of related records, with the collection containing data organized or formatted in a consistent, specific or prescribed way, often in tabular form.

e. “Protected information” means any data, dataset or portion thereof, to which a department or division may deny access pursuant to the California Public Records Act or any other applicable rule regulation, public records law or any other provision of a federal or state law; Protected information includes any data, data set or portion thereof which contains any personally identifiable information or financial identifying information that can be associated with a particular individual through one or more identifiers or other information or circumstances and specifically includes, but is not limited to, a private individual’s home address, personal electronic mail address, personal telephone number, social security number and/or driver’s license number.

f. “Sensitive information” means any data which, if published by the City online, could raise privacy, confidentiality or security concerns, result in the publication of privileged information, result in the publication of information not subject to public disclosure requirements, or have the potential to jeopardize public health, safety or welfare to an extent that is greater than the potential public benefit of publishing that data.

g. <span class="def-public">“Publishable data” means data which is not protected or sensitive and which has been prepared for release to the public.</span>

h. A “Data Dictionary” is a collection of names, definitions, and attributes about data elements that are being used or captured in a database, information system, or part of a research project. It describes the meanings and purposes of data elements within the context of a project, and provides guidance on interpretation, accepted meanings and representation. A Data Dictionary also provides metadata about data elements. The metadata included in a Data Dictionary can assist in defining the scope and characteristics of data elements, as well the rules for their usage and application.

j. The “Data Governance Board” (DGB) is the team that oversees the City’s Data Governance Policy and processes including Open Data and Performance Data initiatives.

k. <span class="g-binding-regulations">“Data Governance Committee(s)” (DGC) are formed by the teams focusing on each of the City’s Strategic Initiatives. Each Committee identifies Goals/Objectives, Strategic Outcomes, and relevant KPIs associated with Performance Data. They also identify and approve relevant Datasets associated with Open Data.</span>

l. “Data Coordinator(s)” are main points of contact and coordination in all data matters for each Data Governance Committee.

m. “Data Steward(s)” are the ‘owners’ of specific Datasets.
