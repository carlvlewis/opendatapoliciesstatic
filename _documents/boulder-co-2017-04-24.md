CITY OF BOULDER

POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

Open Data Policy

EFFECTIVE DATE: 05/02/2017

LAST REVISED: 04/24/2017

Jane Brautigam, City Manager

## I. POLICY

This policy has been developed to support the City of Boulder's commitment to the principles of open government, including transparency, civic engagement and innovation through open and accessible data. For this purpose, the City of Boulder will freely share with constituents, businesses and other jurisdictions the greatest amount of data possible while addressing confidentiality, privacy, and security concerns. Open government is not a solitary initiative, but rather a philosophy to be adopted citywide and throughout all levels of government.

## II. PURPOSE

Government belongs to the people and open government supports this by promoting the public’s right to understand and participate in government. Government has the responsibility to provide relevant and appropriate data and constituents have the opportunity to freely review and utilize the data.

### A. Defining Open Data

Open data is machine-readable data that is free of charge and anyone is free to use, reuse, and redistribute it. It is available online, in an open format, with no legal encumbrances on use or reuse, and is available for all to access and download in full without fees. “Legal encumbrance” as used here, includes federal copyright protections and other, non-statutory legal limitations on how or under what conditions data may be used. Attribution and sharing may be required, but open data is otherwise free of restrictions.

### B. Benefits of Open Data

Open data is beneficial to the City of Boulder and its constituents in the following ways:

1. Open data allows the City of Boulder to increase civic engagement by working with residents and soliciting their ideas, input and creative energy.

2. Open data allows the City of Boulder to use technology to foster open, transparent and accessible government.

3. By sharing data freely, the City of Boulder seeks to develop opportunities for economic development, commerce and increased investment in Boulder and the surrounding region.

4. Publishing structured standardized data in machine-readable formats creates new opportunities for information from different sources to be combined and visualized in new and unexpected ways, for niche markets to be identified and developed, and for constituents to browse, interpret and draw attention to trends or issues with greater efficiency.

5. The adoption of open standards improves transparency, access to public information, and coordination and efficiencies among agencies and partner organizations across the public, non-profit and private sectors.

6. The City of Boulder seeks to encourage the local technology and startup communities to develop software applications and tools to collect, organize and share public data in new and innovative ways.

## III. SCOPE

All public data and datasets collected by the City of Boulder shall be open to the extent permitted by law. Access to all data shall be subject to and consistent with the city’s Access to Public Records policy, the City’s document retention policy, and governing state and federal law, including the Colorado Open Records Act, § 24-72-201, et. seq. All existing city data and datasets will be considered open unless the data or datasets are sensitive or protected information or otherwise exempt from disclosure pursuant to the City’s Access to Open Records Policy.

This policy applies to public data generated, received, collected or stored by or on behalf of the City of Boulder that is non-proprietary, and which has been prepared for release to the public.

Nothing in this policy shall be deemed to prohibit a department from voluntarily disclosing information not otherwise defined as public data nor shall it be deemed to prohibit a department from making such voluntarily disclosed information accessible through the open data catalog. However, such information may not be made public if to do so would violate applicable laws or the City’s Access to Open Records Policy.

This policy applies to all City of Boulder departments, offices, administrative units, commissions, boards, advisory committees or other divisions of the City, including the records of third parties that create or acquire information, records, or data on behalf of the City if such records are identified as belonging to the City.

## IV. DEFINITIONS

Data in this context does not include Word documents, whether draft or final, emails, working papers, or documents with similar purpose.

*Data Catalog* – A central online repository where all open data is stored.

*Dataset* – A collection of related data that is composed of separate elements that can be manipulated as a unit.

*Open Format* – Any widely accepted, nonproprietary, platform-independent, machinereadable data format, which permits automated processing of such data and facilitates analysis and search capabilities.

*Protected Information* – Any dataset or portion thereof to which the City may deny access pursuant to established City policy, the Boulder Revised Municipal Code, City Charter, Federal or State law, privacy laws, copyright, patent, trademark, confidentiality agreement or any other law, rule, regulation or common law privilege. “Protected information” includes data that the City is prohibited from disclosing by operation of law.

*Public Data* – All non-proprietary data generated or received by the City of Boulder which is not protected or sensitive and which has been prepared for release to the public.

*Sensitive Information* – Any data which, if published by the City online, could raise privacy, confidentiality, proprietary or security concerns or have the potential to jeopardize public health, safety, welfare, or cultural or natural resources to an extent that is greater than the potential public benefit of publishing that data.
