Executive Order No. 95

Using Technology to <span class="g-goals-and-values">Promote Transparency, Improve Government Performance and Enhance Citizen Engagement</span>

WHEREAS, the State possesses vast amounts of valuable information and reports on all aspects of life in New York State, including health, business, public safety, and labor data as well as information on transportation, parks, and recreation; and

WHEREAS, new information technology has dramatically changed the way people search for and expect to find information, and such technology can aggregate ever larger quantities of data and allow government to provide information to the public with increasing efficiency; and

WHEREAS, the State can use these powerful tools to enhance public access to government data and make government in New York State more transparent in order to promote public trust; and

WHEREAS, ensuring the quality and consistency of such data is essential to maintaining its value and utility;

NOW, THEREFORE, I, Andrew M. Cuomo, Governor of the State of New York, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and laws of the State of New York, do hereby order as follows:
