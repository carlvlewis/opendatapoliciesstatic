<p/> <p>RELATING TO OPEN DATA.</p> <p/> <p>BE IT ORDAINED by the People of the City and County of Honolulu:</p> <p/> <p>SECTION 1. Findings and Purpose. </p> <p/> <p><span class="g-goals-and-values">The City Council finds that in recent years, the idea that certain data should be freely available to everyone to use and republish as they wish, without restrictions from copyright, patents, or other mechanisms of Control, has become prevalent. This concept, which is generally referred to as open data, applies to data that is already deemed public and made available electronically, such as on a website; it could include department, agency, and legislative data. </span><span class="def-open"><span class="g-goals-and-values">Open data is not data that is subject to privacy, security, confidentiality or any protection of the law.</span></span></p> <p/> <p><span class="def-public"><span class="g-goals-and-values">Information held by the City and County of Honolulu that has been deemed public information by the State Office of Information Practices should be made available in open, standards-based <span class="g-public-apis">machine-readable formats.</span> This may be accomplished by establishing an Application Programming Interface or by hosting the data on the City’s open data portal at https://data.honolulu.</span>qov.</p> <p/> <p>The Council further finds that on June 26, 2012, the Governor issued an Executive Directive to all state department heads announcing the Open Data Initiative. On August 10, 2012, then-candidate and current Mayor Kirk Caldwell, signed an Open Data Pledge. On October 4, 2012, State Chief data officer Sanjeev Bhagowalia unveiled the State</span>’<span class="g-build-on-precedent"><span class="g-goals-and-values">s Twelve Year IT Transformation Plan, </span>which included as one of its top priorities the establishment of a State open data portal at https://data.hawaii.gov. The City followed suit and created https://data.honolulu.qov. These actions enabled public facing websites to facilitate the sharing of master data sets. On July 3, 2013, the Governor signed into law Act 263, which relates to open data. This new law requires state executive branch departments to make electronic data sets available to the public, absolves the State from liability for certain deficiencies or incomplete data, and requires the Chief data officer to <span class="g-data-quality">develop policies and procedures to implement the o</span>pen data initiative.</p> <p/> <p><span class="g-partnerships">Finally, the Council finds that an open data policy has been shown to drive increased government efficiency and civic engagement, leading to social and economic benefits as a result of innovative citizen interaction with government. Social and economic benefits include, but are not limited to, empowering citizens through the democratization of information and fostering citizen participation in city government projects, supporting early stage entrepreneurship, encouraging positive environments that contribute to workforce development and job creation, and fostering a positive business environment and public-private partnerships.</span></span></p> <p/> <p>The purpose of this ordinance is to increase public awareness of and access to data and information created by and available from City departments, agencies, and offices, enhance government transparency and accountability, encourage public engagement, and stimulate innovation with the development of new analyses or applications based on the unique data provided by the City.</p> <p/> <p>SECTION 2.
