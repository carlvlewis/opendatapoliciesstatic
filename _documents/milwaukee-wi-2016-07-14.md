data format, which permits automated processing of such data and facilitates analysis
and search capabilities. 

d. “Metadata” means the date the data was last updated, frequency of data refresh, how the
data is formatted, data field names and explanations for each field.

e. “Dataset” means a named collection of related records, with the collection containing data
organized or formatted in a consistent, specific or prescribed way, often in tabular form
f. “Protected information” means any data, dataset or portion thereof,that is not in the best

access pursuant to the public records laws or any other provision of a federal or state

reasonably anticipated legal or administrative proceedings;
